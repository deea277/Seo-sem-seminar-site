        <h1>Learn how to fly in<span> 4 Weeks</span></h1>
        <p class="tagline">A high-intensity digital guide designed to launch your flight journey in a year.</p>

        <p class="problem">It explores, in detail, the knowledge that every pilot must learn to pass the pilot’s exam and earn their pilot’s license: aerodynamics, handling the controls, reading the instruments, regulations, medical standards, weather, navigation, and mechanics. It describes, in candid and personal terms, the practical challenges—landing an airplane, talking to air traffic control, mastering precise maneuvers, passing the final checkride—that anyone must overcome during flight training to become a pilot.</p>

            <h3>🛡 A blend of technical detail + narrative & personal reflection</h3> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>✈ Context & insight into what being a pilot really demands</h3> <br>
            <p>The book demystifies flying: its history, its practicalities, the regulatory framework, the training pipeline, and the everyday realities behind the romantic idea of flight.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>🛡 Motivation & mindset required to take on big challenges as an adult</h3> <br>
            <p>ecause the author started learning later in life (not as a teenager), the story highlights commitment, perseverance, humility, and the psychological aspects of learning something demanding at a more mature age</p>
